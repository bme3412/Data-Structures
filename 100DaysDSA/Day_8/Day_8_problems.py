### Maximum Average Subarray:
    ### Problem: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the contiguous subarray of size k that has the maximum average value. Return the maximum average value.

### Minimum Size Subarray Sum:
    ### Problem: Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

### Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters:
    ### Problem: Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters

### Fruit Into Baskets:
    ### Problem: You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each. Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you must collect as much fruit as possible while still following the baskets rule.
