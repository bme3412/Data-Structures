### String Matching

"""Implement a function that finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string using the brute force approach."""

""" Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find the first occurrence of a pattern string within a text string."""

""" Given a text string and multiple pattern strings, use the Aho-Corasick algorithm to find all occurrences of the patterns in the text."""

""" Implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find the last occurrence of a pattern string within a text string."""

"""Given a text string and a pattern string, find the longest prefix of the pattern that matches a substring of the text using the KMP failure function."""

## String Manipulation:

"""Implement a function to reverse a string in-place without using any built-in functions."""

"""Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) while ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters."""

"""Implement a function to convert a string to title case, where the first character of each word is uppercase, and the remaining characters are lowercase."""

"""Given a string, find the longest substring that contains only unique characters."""

"""Implement a function to check if a string is a valid palindrome permutation, meaning it can be rearranged to form a palindrome."""

"""Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1."""

"""Implement a function to remove all occurrences of a given substring from a string."""

"""Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters."""

"""Implement a function to convert a string to a valid palindrome by making the minimum number of character replacements."""

"""Given two strings, find the longest common substring between them."""
