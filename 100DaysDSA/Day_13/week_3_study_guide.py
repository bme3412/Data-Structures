## Week 3:

## Day 1: Introduction to Linked Lists
    ## Understand the concept of linked lists and their advantages over arrays
    ## Learn about the structure of a node (data and pointer)
    ## Explore singly linked lists and their basic operations

## Day 2: Singly Linked Lists - Insertion
    ## Implement insertion at the beginning of a singly linked list
    ## Implement insertion at the end of a singly linked list
    ## Practice inserting nodes at specific positions in a singly linked list

## Day 3: Singly Linked Lists - Deletion
    ## Implement deletion of the first node in a singly linked list
    ## Implement deletion of the last node in a singly linked list
    ## Practice deleting nodes at specific positions in a singly linked list

## Day 4: Singly Linked Lists - Traversal and Searching
    ## Implement traversal of a singly linked list (printing all elements)
    ## Implement searching for a specific element in a singly linked list
    ## Practice solving problems that involve traversing and searching singly linked lists

## Day 5: Singly Linked Lists - Practice Problems
    ## Solve practice problems on singly linked list manipulation
    ## Implement solutions to problems like finding the middle element, detecting loops, etc.

## Day 6: Introduction to Doubly Linked Lists
    ## Understand the structure of a doubly linked list node (data, previous pointer, next pointer)
    ## Compare doubly linked lists with singly linked lists
    ## Explore the basic operations of doubly linked lists

## Day 7: Doubly Linked Lists - Insertion and Deletion
    ## Implement insertion at the beginning, end, and specific positions in a doubly linked list
    ## Implement deletion from the beginning, end, and specific positions in a doubly linked list
    ## Practice solving problems involving insertion and deletion in doubly linked lists##
